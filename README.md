## Usage

(1) Copy an image or path to a file to your clipboard

(2) Run `python clipboard_to_url.py`

(3) Paste the URL

## Setup

(1) Create a bucket https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets

(2) Make the bucket public by granting the `Storage Object Viewer` role to the `allUsers` principal (see [this](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/making-data-public) guide for more details). This allows anyone on the internet to _view_ files that are in this bucket, but only you can upload files to this bucket. When all is said and done, it should look like [this](https://github.com/kym6464/clipboard-to-url/assets/36041631/a50e0832-ff02-4ffb-84a2-69a711fa507f)

(3) Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill out the values

(4) Authenticate with google cloud https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/client-libraries

(5) Create a python virtual environment `python -m venv env`

(6) Install dependencies `pip install wheel && pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Mac Finder Integration

To integrate with [Quick Actions](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/perform-quick-actions-in-the-finder-on-mac-mchl97ff9142/mac) like in the above demo, use [Automator](https://support.apple.com/guide/automator/welcome/mac) to invoke the script with files â€” [this](https://github.com/kym6464/clipboard-to-url/assets/36041631/eaaab735-52d5-485c-978e-9ce66ed70f74) is what the final product could look like

```
pbcopy && /Users/kym/repos/clipboard-to-url/env/bin/python "/Users/kym/repos/clipboard-to-url/clipboard_to_url.py"
```
